# Active-Contours
A python realization of the paper [Active contours without edges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/902291).

Reinitialization based on the paper [A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999184711557).
