# Edge Detection

Realizations of various edge detection methods in image processing.

## Active-Contours

Based on: *Chan, T. F., & Vese, L. A. (2001). Active contours without edges. IEEE Transactions on image processing, 10(2), 266-277.*

A PDE based image segmentation algorithm.

## Fast-Algorithm

Based on: *Song, B., & Chan, T. (2002). A fast algorithm for level set based optimization. UCLA Cam Report, 2(68).*

A faster way of image segmentation based on the idea that what we really need to know in the Chan-Vese model are not the values of $\phi$ but the signs.
